# HollaDieWaldfee's repository of the Dodo Margin Trading audit contest
The repo contains all source files with my notes in them.  
Some notes were on paper, but the paper is in the trash by now.  

Also, I added a [screenshot](./notion-notes.png) of my notion notes where I keep a rough overview of my progress.
